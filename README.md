# android-ago

This library provides `RelativeTimeTextView`, a custom `TextView` that takes a reference time and always displays the relative time with respect to the reference point, **automatically refreshing the display text as needed**. This is a common pattern seen in several apps like chat apps, social networking, email etc.

![Here is a screenshot from the sample app][1]

This library can be seen as a wrapper on top of the excellent `android.text.format.DateUtils` class. Note that the library does _not_ expose all the options provided by the `DateUtils` class. I have left out many features because I couldn't decide what would be the best way to achieve the flexibility - dozens of XML attributes? Contributions in this regard are welcome.

## Why should I use this instead of DateUtils class?

Because this library **automatically refreshes the display text as needed**. It internally uses `DateUtils` class.

Imagine you use `DateUtils` directly without using this library.
  - Imagine that it is **9 am** now. You set a reference time of **9:05 am**. Your TextView displays `in 5 mins`
  - Now the time becomes **9:01 am**. You still display `in 5 mins` even though you should be showing `in 4 mins`
  
To do this correctly, you will need to keep refreshing the text views every minute. However, even that is not necessary. If the reference time is 3 hours from now, you only need to refresh every hour - not every minute.

This library handles all of this for you. `RelativeTimeTextView` automatically refreshes the display text _**only as often as necessary**_.


# Obtaining

### Gradle

Add the following to your build.gradle

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.curioustechizen.android-ago:library:1.4.0'
    }

**Important:** v1.3.4 Fixed a major bug (#47). If you are using an older version, please update to at least 1.3.4 now.

### Eclipse+ADT
  1. Clone the repo
  2. In Eclipse, go to `File` -> `New` -> `Other`. Expand `Android` and select `Android Project from Existing Code`
  3. Browse to the `android-ago` sub-folder of the cloned repo and hit `Finish`


# Usage
  - Include `RelativeTimeTextView` in your layouts. 
  - Set the reference time either using `setReferenceTime` method or using the XML attribute `reference_time`.
  
In your layout:
```xml
<com.github.curioustechizen.ago.RelativeTimeTextView
    android:id="@+id/timestamp"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginTop="@dimen/margin_primary" />
```

In your Java code:
```java
RelativeTimeTextView v = (RelativeTimeTextView)findViewById(R.id.timestamp); //Or just use Butterknife!
v.setReferenceTime(new Date().getTime());
```

See the sample project for a concrete example.

## Customization

By default, this library simply calls `DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString`. This might not be sufficient for you. For example, you might need to add a prefix. RTTV provides a hook for such cases - the `getRelativeTimeDisplayString` method. You can override this method and add whatever prefixes or suffixes you need.

Here is a simple example:

```xml
<!-- strings.xml -->
<string name="format_relative_time_with_prefix">Updated %1$s</string>
```

```java
class PrefixRttv extends RelativeTimeTextView {
    @Override
    protected CharSequence getRelativeTimeDisplayString(long referenceTime, long now) {
        final String relativeTime = super.getRelativeTimeDisplayString(referenceTime, now);
        return getResources.getString(R.string.format_relative_time_with_prefix, relativeTime);
    }    
}
```

## Advanced customization

What if the string returned by `DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString` does not suit you? Well, you can still use RTTV for its auto-refresh capability and take over complete control of the display string itself. Simply override `getRelativeTimeDisplayString` and don't call through to the `super`  method. Instead, perform your own logic and return whatever string you wish here.

```xml
<!-- strings.xml -->
<string name="future">Some day, in the distance future</string>
<string name="past">Once upon a time, long long ago</string>
<string name="now">Right NOW!</string>
```

```java
class FullyCustomRttv extends RelativeTimeTextView {
    @Override
    protected CharSequence getRelativeTimeDisplayString(long referenceTime, long now) {
        //Notice that we don't call super here.
        int resourceId = 0;
        if(referenceTime == now) resourceId = R.string.now;
        else if(referenceTime > now) resourceId = R.string.future;
        else resourceId = R.string.past;
        
        return getResources().getString(resourceId);
    }    
}
```

See the examples in the sample project for more details.

## Who's Using this Library?

See [here](https://github.com/curioustechizen/android-ago/wiki/Apps-using-android-ago). If you would like to add your app to this list, please edit the wiki.


## Android version support statement

The library has been tested on API 11 and above. However, theoretically, it works on API 3 and above since all it uses is [DateUtils#getRelativeTimeSpanString](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/DateUtils.html#getRelativeTimeSpanString(long, long, long, int)).

The minSdkVersion has been set to 8, however do not expect support from me for API version < 11.


# Usage with Data Binding
